Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Decision Tree 

1. Implement a decision tree to predict housing prices for the given dataset using the
available features.
2. The various attributes of the data are explained in the file data description.txt.
Note that some attributes are categorical while others are continuos.
3. Feel Free to use Python libraries such as binarytree or any other library in Python
to implement the binary tree. However, you cannot use libraries like scikit-learn
which automatically create the decision tree for you.
4. Experiment with different measures for choosing how to split a node(Gini impurity,
information gain, variance reduction) . You could also try different approaches to
decide when to terminate the tree.
5. Report metrics such as Mean Squared Error(MSE) and Mean Absolute Error(MAE)
along with any other metrics that you feel may be useful.

Airfoil  Linear Regression
1. Given a NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests
of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections. Implement a linear regression
model from scratch using gradient descent to predict scaled sound pressure level.
The various attributes of the data are explained in the file description.txt.
2. Using appropriate plot show how number of iterations is affecting the mean squared
error for above model under below given conditions:
(a) Using 3 different initial regression coefficients (weights) for fixed value of learning parameter (All 3 in single plot).
(b) Using 3 different learning parameters for some fixed initial regression coefficients. (All 3 in single plot)
3. If you want to apply regression on some dataset but one of itâ€™s features has missing
values under below given conditions, how will you approach the problem. (No need
of Code Experimentation)
(a) When 0-0.5% of values are missing of that feature
(b) When 8-10% of values are missing of that feature
(c) When 60-70% of values are missing of that feature


Weather Linear Regression 

1. Given a dataset containing historical weather information of certain area, implement a linear regression model from scratch using gradient descent to predict the
apparent temperature. The various attributes of the data are explained in the file
description.txt. Note that attributes are text, categorical as well as continuous.
Note: Test data will have 10 columns. Apparent temperature column will be
missing from in between.
2. Compare the performance of different error functions ( Mean square error, Mean
Absolute error, Mean absolute percentage error) and explain the reasons for the
observed behaviour.
3. Analyse and report the behaviour of the regression coefficients(for example: sign
of coefficients, value of coefficients etc.) and support it with appropriate plots as
necessary.
